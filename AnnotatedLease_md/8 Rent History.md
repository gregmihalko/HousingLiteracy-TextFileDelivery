8 Rent History
As a rent stabilized tenant, you are entitled to know your rent history. You can access this information in several ways:

(1) fill out the online contact form  (see below for link)
(2) calling the Rent Info Hotline
(3) visiting your Borough or district office in person
(4) requesting your records via mail

The Tenant Protection Unitâ€™s website outlines how to access these records and what you will need to do so. Filling out the online contact form is the easiest method.

You can also use the Am I Rent Stabilized website to see if your building has been listed as having filed records about rent regulation in the years since 1984. This method, however, is less reliable and only lists the building, not the unit that is under rent regulation. It is important to remember that not every unit in a building is necessarily rent-regulated.
