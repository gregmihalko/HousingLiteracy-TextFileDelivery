# 10 (1) Expiration of J-51 or 421-a Tax Abatements

(1) Expiration of J-51 or 421-a Tax Abatements and Exemptions. In exchange for applying rent regulation benefits to their building or some of its units, the city offers tax abatements to landlords that reduce the amount of property tax they have to pay, and tax exemptions that serve as credits for taxes that are to be paid. There are two types of tax abatements/exemptions that landlords can receive if they apply for them, J-51 or 421-a. J-51 applies to either fully rehabilitated or converted units, while 421-a applies to only newly constructed units.

J-51. A J-51 is for units that have either been fully rehabilitated or converted from another use, like if a unit was used as an office space and now it’s someone’s apartment or if the unit was gut renovated. While tax benefit periods can vary, they are usually for 12 year for J-51 programs. Knowing the rent regulation status before the J-51 tax benefit was used by the landlord is important because not all expirations of J-51 tax benefits impact rent regulation status. 

If the building was rent-regulated before the tax benefit was applied (generally the building was built before 1974 and contains more than six apartments units), then the building will remain rent-regulated even if the tax benefits expires. So, if the unit was regulated before the J-51 tax benefits were applied, then the unit will remain rent-regulated even when the tax benefits expire for the landlord. 

However, if the unit became rent-regulated because the landlord took the J-51 tax abatement (generally in buildings that were constructed after 1974), then it is likely that the unit would no longer be rent-regulated when the J-51 tax benefit ends. Generally tax benefits will end when the last lease signed under the tax benefits ends. So, for example, if the J-51 program expires in June of 2016, and your lease ends in December of 2016, then the rent regulation status ends when your lease ends and the landlord can offer you or another tenant a market rate lease. 

However, this depends on whether or not the landlord gave you proper notice. Proper notice means that the landlord included a notice in 12-point font in the original lease and all subsequent renewals that stated (1) that the unit could be deregulated when the tax abatement benefits expired and (2) included the approximate date when rent regulation coverage would expire. If the original lease and the subsequent renewals do not have such a notice, the tenant has grounds to keep the unit rent-regulated even after the tax benefits expire for the landlord.

421-a. This program applies only to newly constructed units. Generally units built after 1974 are not subject to rent regulation, but have been placed under rent regulation because the landlord has chosen to take 421-a benefits. For units constructed after July 3, 1984, landlords are required to include in each lease and lease renewal proper notification (see above) both a notice that the rent regulation status will expire when the 421-a tax benefits expire, as well as the approximate date of expiration. If your lease extends beyond the date when tax benefits expire, deregulation takes effect when the last lease that was signed under the 421-a program expires (see previous example).  


June 30, 2008 is an important date. If construction began before June 30, 2008, then the units remain regulated until the last lease entered into during the 421-a tax benefits period. Once that lease expires, the rent regulation also expires. However, if the landlord fails to include the proper notice (see above), then the unit is de-regulated only when that current tenant decides to leave. For units where construction began on or after June 30, 2008, remain regulated for the duration of the tax benefits (usually 35 years) and then become de-regulated only when the tenant residing in the unit when the benefits expires leaves the apartment.

Challenging Increases.
There is generally no mechanism to stop the expiration of tax benefits, and only under some circumstances will rent regulation status remain after tax benefits have expired. 
In the case of J-51, units will only remain regulated after the expiration of tax benefits if the unit was already stabilized before the landlord accepted tax benefits.
In the case of 421-a, for units in which construction began before June 30, 2008, they will only remain regulated after the expiration of tax benefits if there was not proper notification—even then it’s only until the tenant living in the unit when the benefits period expired leaves, after which they will be deregulated. For units in which construction began on or after June 30, 2008, they will only remain regulated until the tenant occupying the unit leaves, as long as there was proper notification and their leaving the unit was not the result of harassment.
