#10 (2) Conversion to a co-op or a condominium

(2) Conversion to a co-op or a condominium.
When a rent-regulated unit is converted to a co-op or condominium, there are often two possible scenarios: either (1) tenants have the option to purchase the unit themselves and either stay there or rent it out to someone else, or (2) someone else buys the unit. If someone else buys the unit, the buyer or landlord can either (1) let the current tenant stay in their rent-regulated unit or (2) they can evict them. For 90 days after the final offering for a co-op is determined, the tenants in a rent-regulated unit have an option to buy or purchase their share and the unit cannot be shown to prospective buyers. If a new tenant moves into a vacant unit that has been converted, they will no long be covered by rent regulation laws. 

Under an eviction plan, tenants cannot be evicted by the purchaser of a co-op or a condominium unit for a minimum of three years after the eviction plan goes into effect. If their lease expires before the three years is up, they are offered another lease that will end when the minimum three years are up. The new lease must be under the same terms as their original lease as rent-regulated tenant. Under a non-eviction plan, tenants cannot be evicted and are will remain in their units as rent-regulated tenants.
