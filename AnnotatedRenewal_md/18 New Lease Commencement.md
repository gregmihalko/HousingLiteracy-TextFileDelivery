#18 New Lease Commencement
Item 7 indicates the dates when the new lease will commence and terminate. 

Generally, the new lease will commence the day after you prior lease expires, as indicated in item 1. So for example, if my current lease expires on 3/31/2018, then the new lease will commence on 4/1/2018.  The new lease will terminate either 1 or 2 years from when it expires, that is, on either 4/1/2019 or 4/1/2020, depending on which lease the tenant selects.
