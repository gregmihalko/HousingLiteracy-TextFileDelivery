#16 Preferential Rent Riders
Item 5 lists the preferential rent and indicates whether there is a preferential rent rider attached. 

A preferential rent rider would be a document that clarifies a condition or a special arrangement to the rental lease. Preferential rent riders are not common, especially because it benefits the landlord when the tenant does not know they are paying a preferential rent. Since rent controls constrain how much landlords can charge for rents, the ability of landlords to legally charge more is useful if they are trying to force tenants out so they can add in vacancy bonuses to more quickly attain the deregulation rent threshold. This is a common technique in gentrifying neighborhoods where the sudden influx of residents able to pay higher rents incentivizes landlords to more quickly deregulate their apartments so they can charge market rates. 

Hereâ€™s a good article on how preferential rents are used against tenants:

When there is a preferential rent rider attached to the lease, it will generally specify that the preferential rent has been agreed upon by both parties for the duration of the tenancy of the individual tenant. Tenants receiving a SCRIE (Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption) or DRIE (Disability Rent Increase Exemption) are among the most likely to have a preferential rent rider.
