#28 Choice to Reject or Accept Offer
This section notifies the tenant that if they desire to remain in their rent-regulated unit, they must check the appropriate box in Part B and return the signed copy of the lease renewal to their landlord within 60 days of when they originally received it. 
 Again, if the landlord is late in offering a lease to the tenant, the tenant has two options: Option 1, they can stick with the original timeline and begin the lease as if a timely offer been made or option 2, they can begin the lease no less than 90 days after days after the offer has been made to the tenant. The following example is helpful in illustrating this.

An example: 

(1)	Mr. Rivera’s lease expired on July 31, 2011. He did not receive a timely renewal offer between 150 or 90 days of when his lease was set to expire. So he kept paying his rent of $800. 
(2)	On May 15, 2012, the landlord offers a retroactive lease renewal to begin on August 1, 2011, with rates based upon the 2011 1-year and 2-year renewal rates as approved by the Rent Guidelines Board. 
(3)	The choice of when the new lease will start is up to Mr. Rivera. He can have it start on either (1) August 1, 2011 when it was originally supposed to start, or (2) he can have the lease start on September 1, 2012, roughly 90 days from when he received the lease renewal offer. 
(4)	While the landlord offered the lease renewal at the allowable increase rates of 2011, the rates for 2012 were actually lower. Mr. Rivera is liable for the lower rates, which would be those for 2012. 

If the tenant fails to return a signed copy of the lease renewal indicating their decision to stay within 60 days of when they received it from their landlord, the landlord can refuse to renew the lease and move to evict the tenant.
