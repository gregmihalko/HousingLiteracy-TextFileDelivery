#27 Return Copy
This paragraph notifies landlords of their responsibility to return a copy of the fully executed lease (signed by both parties—tenants and landlord) to the tenants. 

If the tenant has not received a copy of the fully executed lease with 30 days of when the landlord received the tenant’s signed copies, the tenant should both notify their landlord and file a complaint with the DHCR. Filing a complaint is an important step in demonstrating your compliance with rent regulation and could be useful in defending your actions in court, if necessary. 

The Tenant should mark the appropriate box in Part III “Nature of the Complaint” on the "Tenant's Complaint of Owner's Failure to Renew Lease and/or Failure to Furnish a Copy of a Signed Lease" form. The form can be accessed, here:
