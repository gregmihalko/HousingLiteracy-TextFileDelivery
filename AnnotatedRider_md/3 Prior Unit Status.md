# 3 Prior Unit Status
*Here, the landlord must clarify the status of the unit prior to offering the vacancy lease to the current tenant.*

In this rider, the landlord must indicate the status of the unit prior to when the current tenant moved in. Box A is on page 1 and Boxes B, C, and D are all on page 3. 

- **Box A:** If the unit was *rent-stabilized* when the last tenant moved out.
- **Box B:** If the unit was *rent-controlled* when the last tenant moved out.
- **Box C:** If the unit is subject to some other government program that specifies the rent.
- **Box D:** If the unit has been renovated or altered in some way as to affect the rent that can be charged.


**Box A**


**Box B**
If the unit was formerly rent-controlled, the unit now becomes rent-stabilized. However, the initial rent determined for that unit is initially a “fair market rent” for that neighborhood, to which the landlord and the tenant agree. After that rent has been raised to a “fair market rent,” the landlord can then only increase the rent in accordance with rent-regulation laws (i.e., IAI, MCIs, and Rent Guideline Board Increases). If the tenant feels that the rent being charged is not a “fair market rent,” they may appeal to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). Tenants using the “Fair Market Appeal Form,” or contact the DHCR’s Office of Rent Administration at (718) 739-6400. 

One important note: If a unit was previously rent-controlled and the rent charged to the next tenant is at or above the Deregulation Rent Threshold, the unit can be deregulated. So, a unit can move from being rent-controlled to completely deregulated. Here again, the tenant moving in could challenge the deregulation by filing a “Fair Market Appeal” with the DHCR.
